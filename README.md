# Microscopy Image Treatment
MatLab scripts for the treatment of fluorescence microcopy images, such as TIRF and Spinning Disk. The available treatment methods are:

1) Alignment of image channels acquired with two separate camera's. Requires a calibration image with the same fluorescent bead sample in both channels.
2) Drift correction based on static features in the image.
3) Wiener filter
4) Wallis filter
5) Background subtraction
6) Photobleaching correction

See [Manual - Image Treatment.pdf](Manual%20-%20Image%20Treatment.pdf) for detailed user information.

## Usage
This tool is not offered as a standalone application, but as a set of scripts to be run in MATLAB. To use the scripts, you need to have MATLAB installed on your computer.

You can start the User Interface by running the `GUI.m` file in MATLAB.
