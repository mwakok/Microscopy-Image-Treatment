(see "Manual - Image Treatment.pdf" for detailed information)
 
MatLab scripts for the treatment of fluorescence microcopy images, such as TIRF and Spinning Disk. The available treatment methods are:

1) Alignment of image channels acquired with two separate camera's. Requires a calibration image with the same fluorescent bead sample in both channels.
2) Drift correction based on static features in the image.
3) Wiener filter
4) Wallis filter
5) Background subtraction
6) Photobleaching correction
